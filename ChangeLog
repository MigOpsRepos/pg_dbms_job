Sat Aug 28 2021 - Version 1.1.0

This release is maintenance release since last release to fix some
possible wrong behaviors, control other ones and improve documentation.

 - Add configuration directive job_queue_processes to control the limit
   of jobs that can be run at the same time.
 - Fix insertion failure in job history table when PQSTATUS returned
   contains single quote.
 - Fix possible case where asynchronous jobs can be executed twice
   if they are not removed fast enough from the queue.
 - Fix regression test to use latest SQL version of the extension.
 - Add limitations on pg_dbms_job use and especially about the NOTIFY
   queue size limits. Thanks to Julien Rouhaud for the report.
 - Add missing information on how to stop or reload configuration of
   the scheduler.
 - Add information that unlike with cron-like scheduler, when the scheduler
   starts it executes all active jobs with a next date in the past.
 - Add information that jobs are executed with the role that has submitted
   the job and with the search path was used at job creation time.
