Mon Apr 11 2022 - Version 1.2.0

This release is maintenance release since last release to fix issues
reported by users since the past height months. It also adds some
improvements.

  * Add configuration directive job_queue_processes to control the
    maximum number of job processed at the same time.
  * Keep entries in the jobs table to be able to monitor the duration
    of a task. Thank to Jagrab3 for the patch.
  * Allow strftime() escapes in log filename, for example to have a
    log file per week day use %a in the file name.
  * Add new configuration directive log_truncate_on_rotation to truncate file
    on rotation. When activated an existing log file with the same name as the
    new log file will be truncated rather than appended to. But such truncation
    only occurs on time-driven rotation, not on restarts.
    Thanks to K RamaKrishna Sastry for the feature request.
  * Allow pg_dbms_job to run on a standby server without reporting error.
    The daemon detects that it is running on a standby and disconnect
    immediately, it will try to connect 3 seconds later. Thanks to
    K RamaKrishna Sastry for the feature request.
  * Try to reconnect PostgreSQL after 3 seconds when the connection fail.
    Thanks to K RamaKrishna Sastry for the report.

  - Fix an extract comma that make the update on failure fail.
  - Fix single execution mode with lasted change on connection error and
    update regression tests configuration file.
